# MNIST_CompVision

A simple Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) written in python using tensorflow to recognize hand written digits from the MNIST dataset. This CNN contains 2 convolution layers followed by a fully connected layer. I also used neuron dropout to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
